    <h1>Machine learning</h1>
    <p>Machine learning is a powerful and evolving field that empowers computers to learn from data and improve their
        performance without being explicitly programmed. By analyzing patterns and relationships, ML systems can make
        predictions, detect anomalies, or even recognize speech and images. At its core, machine learning is divided
        into key branches like supervised learning (where models learn from labeled data), unsupervised learning (which
        finds hidden structures in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (where agents learn by interacting with
        environments). For a web developer like you, Raman, integrating ML into projects opens doors to intelligent
        features like recommendation engines, sentiment analysis, or personalized user experiencesâ€”blending logic with
        creativity in ways that elevate both design and functionality.</p>
